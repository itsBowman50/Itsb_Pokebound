  "description" : "Adds in a variety of items like custom recipes, berry bushes, and Pokeballs. I also plan on adding more items from the Pokemon universe. All the Pokeballs are all there own capture pods so you can have them all at one time! There's a new crafting bench that allows you to craft Pokeballs called PokeCraft Station. Here you can craft all your Pokemon related items. NO LONGER REQUIRES: Custom Collections. I've went and made a handheld collection system (AKA the Pokedex).\n\nDisclaimer: Once you download this mod theres no going back after installing. Works best if you start a new character. Back up your game before downloading this mod.\n\n\nIf you want to spawn in any Pokemon or any of the items look in the discussions\n\nMore coming...\n\n\n\nLet me know wat y'all think and if you have any suggestions for first generation Pokemon let me know. If you encounter bugs or you just wanna talk Pokemon please go to my discord chat and I'll be glad to help you: https://discord.gg/uTwRFbx or comment in the disscusion below.\n\nThank you and Enjoy!",
